# Minesweeper Challenge

## Goal - Learn Test Driven Development

I improved my TDD practice by doing one thing: repeating the same exercise about fifty times. This is what I invite you to do by following the Minesweeper challenge.

The goal is to master a kata with the same name and refine the practice week after week. Repetition is the foundation of the system.

## Practical Information

The challenge will start on Tuesday, April 1st, and end on Friday, May 30th (dates may change).

## The Minesweeper Kata

The goal is to create a `minesweeper` function that solves the Minesweeper game. An example will make it clearer.

Here is a mine grid represented by the following string:
```
.*.**.
....*.
..*...
```

The `minesweeper` function should return the following string:

```
1*2**2
1234*2
01*211
```

The goal is to return a string indicating how many mines surround each cell.

### Constraints

Each week, I will introduce constraints to guide the challenge execution.
