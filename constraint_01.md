# Constraint 01: Knowing What to Develop  

In your code, you must demonstrate that you understand what is expected of you. Even before writing the first line of code, you need to prove that you know what you are doing.  

To achieve this, you will use examples.  

## Conditions  
- You must work in a single file, the test file  
- The examples must appear at the top of your file  
- Once you think you have enough examples, you can start coding  

## Reference  
You can look into the following concepts for the examples:  
- example mapping  
- specification by example
